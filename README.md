## Gaussian-Mixture-Model

In this repo. I demonstrated how to implement and  apply `Expectation Maximization Algorithm` on a `Gaussian Mixture Model`, and how to perform `Principal Component Analysis` on a high dimensional dataset using scikit-learn.

## Installation

To use the library, you simply download  the `gmmlib.py` into your working directory and add ``import gmmlib`` to your python file. The math and theory of EM algorithm and GMM are explained in the two demo notebook.
